Given a binary tree, we install cameras on the nodes of the tree. 
Each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.
Calculate the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.

Input Description:
First line contains, n the size of values in binary tree.
Second line contains, n elements of inputs for binary tree.

Output Description:
Print the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.

Sample Input:
5
1 2 3 4 5

Sample Output:
2

Explanation:
The given Tree,
      1
     / \
    2   3
   / \
  4   5
so we need cameras at 1 and 2 so that we can monitor all the nodes.
